<u><b>Hi-Run Rule:</b></u>
<p>
You’ll get 1 point for your best run within a given match that passes 50% of your TARGET goal. If you
play 2 or 3 matches a night, it’s possible to get a maximum of 3 points that night if you have 3 hi-runs
that exceed 50% of your TARGET goal. Your accumulated points will be tracked and reported weekly on
the following link: <a href="https://aspastats.appspot.com/LS/hr">/https://aspastats.appspot.com/LS/hr/</a>
<p>
At the end of the session, the player that has the highest number of points accumulated throughout the
session will win the Session Hi-Run pot of <font color="#FF0000">$300</font> (guaranteed). This Hi-Run formula is the best equalizer
factor to guarantee that everyone has an equal chance of winning the pot regardless of their handicap
rating or Win/Lose record. It also helps you to improve your game while focusing on making more balls.
<p>
Last session, Johnny Wilson (Rating Handicap ~ 585) exceeded 50% of his TARGET goal (26 balls) 5 times
got 5 points, and took home the Session Hi-Run of $500. Horia (handicap = 724), Kim (handicap
= 605), and two othes were runner-ups with only 2 points earned. See the below chart for your reference…
